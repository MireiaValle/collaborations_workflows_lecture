## Goals for today 

Discuss how to write **really** reproducible code that enables others to:

- Identify decision points in your code
- Understand your methods
- Regenerate your results 

Do better science in less time! [Lowndes et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)

## Housekeeping and disclaimers

More lecturing and less demo-ing today

Using my own code as an example where possible 

Please speak up or comment in the chat window

I have no CS background and learned everything I know from you and from Twitter

## Outline

Tools, tips, and tricks for: 

1. Organizing your data
1. Coding workflows and best practices
1. Repositories / projects / environments
1. Project management 
1. Collaborating across skill levels and programming languages

## 1. Organizing your data

Anticipate that your code and data will be published with every completed project/paper

- OK: package data with its own metadata in a universal file format
- Better: deposit data in an archival repository with metadata 
- Best: include code to extract data from an online source

*unofficial, Alexa-determined ranking*

## 1.1 Data: Web scraping / APIs 

*Allows others to reproduce your results directly from scripts without requiring any additional data files*

R packages that allow you to communicate with servers and access data from R, often through [ropensci](https://github.com/ropensci)

- [rerddap](https://github.com/ropensci/rerddap) 
- [rfishbase](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/rfishbase_tutorial/) 
- [rnaturalearth](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth) 
- [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet)
- Others? 

Can also write your own API in R (have you done this?) 

Check regularly if these are available for major datasets you use 

## 1.2 Data: Depositing in archives 

Forces you to organize your data and document it in a way that facilitates reproducible science

- Includes using [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)

Likely to last longer than project-specific data links, repositories, or R packages 

- Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity, [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/)
- [FigShare](https://figshare.com/)

Lots of resources at NCEAS including the [Reproducible Research course](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2019-11-RRCourse/)

## 1.3 Data: Packaging it yourself

Use flexible file formats that don't require certain software (like .xlsx) or programming languages (.Rdata, .rds)

- .csv for tabular data, .nc for spatial data 

Write metadata conforming to field standards and package with the data 

Consider wrapping in an [R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html) (requires more maintenance, less accessible to non-R users)

Try to host data at a stable link 

## 2.1 Coding: script organization

My philosophy:

- 1 script, ~1 task (no more than one section of Methods)
- List decision points / user choices at the top so itâ€™s obvious what they are

[A bad script](https://github.com/afredston/neus-range-edges/blob/master/scripts/analyze_edges.R) 

[A better script](https://github.com/afredston/neus-range-edges/blob/master/scripts/clean_trawl_data.R)

## 2.2 Coding: functional programming 

Pull out complex and/or repeated operations, write them as functions, and move to "functions" folder [example](https://github.com/afredston/neus-range-edges/blob/master/functions/sfc_as_cols.R)

Simpler operations can still be defined as functions within a script [example](https://github.com/afredston/neus-range-edges/blob/master/scripts/isotherms.R)

[purrr](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/index.html) is great, but don't be afraid to write functions with for loops or apply! 

## 2.3 Coding: RMarkdown

Makes code much easier to annotate and visualize

Pros: 

- Great for describing a workflow or reporting out your findings 
- I most frequently use this to generate PDFs and share with collaborators
- Can streamline analysis-to-paper pipeline, if you write papers with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) (anyone?) 

Cons: 

- Clunky to do large analyses in .Rmd scripts 

## 2.4 Coding: workflow 

- Try to pause coding when a task is complete 
- Leave a to-do list for others (and yourself!) of what, if anything, still needs to happen for that script to be functional
- pull + commit + pull + push frequently 
- Restart R frequently (ensures you've loaded the right packages)

## 3.1 Use version control

To use git and prevent problems: https://happygitwithr.com/

To deal with problems like merge conflicts: https://ohshitgit.com/ 

## 3.2 Use projects, seriously 

Every project begins with a new github repository and a new [R project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) filed under ~/github/repo_name 

Projects allow you to:

- Work safely on different scripts in different windows 
- Develop custom environments like in Python / other languages, e.g. with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

## 3.2 Project/repository organization

Organize repositories consistently

- [JC's function for this purpose](https://rdrr.io/github/jcvdav/startR/src/R/create_dirs.R)
- [My general structure](https://github.com/afredston/neus-range-edges)

Describe what each script does, somewhere (I use readme)

Use [here()](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) to manage file paths 

## 4.1 Project management: GitHub issues 

[Github issues](https://github.com/features/project-management/) are designed for project management [example](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/issues)

Useful whether or not everyone codes 

## 4.2 Project management: "how we work"

Agree on shared practices for data storage, script development, communication, etc. at the start of a project, and document them in a Google Doc, GitHub Wiki, etc. [example](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work)

## 5.1 Collaboration: editing other people's code

## 5.2 Collaboration: different open-source programming languages

Extra important to have good communication and division of tasks (see "how we work")

Can still use git for version control of scripts in ~/github/repo_name (possibly from the command line)

Write out and read in data in flexible formats that translate across the languages you're using 

- [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) lets you run Python code from RStudio (still need to understand Python a little bit)
- [databricks](https://databricks.com/)

Other ideas? 

## 5.3: Collaboration: proprietary software

Many scientists feel strongly about using ArcGIS, MATLAB, etc. 

Best practices about version control and data management all apply

Half a reproducible project is better than none! 

## 5.4 Collaboration: non R / GitHub people

Most people can at least interface with a GitHub repo to view and download files, and use Issues

Most people are also OK with you transitioning a project to an open reproducible workflow, if you do all the work! 

- RMarkdown/Shiny to show code and results 
- RMarkdown interface to Microsoft Word (has anyone tried this?) 
- Google Docs > Microsoft Word 
- People are worth more to projects than tools 

Other thoughts? 

## To incorporate

How to get collaborators to buy in and stop emailing code back and forth
